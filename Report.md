# Data Science approach on Luis Suárez shooting habits

## Project description

This project follows a current tech trend on football - Data Science applied to football game events. Presently, some of the biggest clubs have an internal Data Analytics department that develops projects on different fields like game event analysis, scouting, training, etc. This project is specifically dedicated to game event analysis of a player - I am performing a thorough analysis on Luis Suárez shooting habits on the three last La Liga seasons.

## Data Source & Technologies used

StatsBomb provides free football data, containing  multiple competitions on different seasons. Each game is described by a dataset with an average of 4000 events that happened throughout the game. The source of the data is [here](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data).

I used Python to do the data cleaning, and Tableau and matplotlib to perform data visualization.


## Objective

The objective of this project is to identify weaknesses in Luis Suárez shots, so that,  the training staff of FC Barcelona can create an individual training program designed to improve the existing weaknesses.

On the other side, this project is also useful from the goalkeeper’s perspective. It could also be used by opponent teams to train their goalkeepers before a match with FC Barcelona.
